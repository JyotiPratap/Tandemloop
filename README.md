Problem1:- we define 4 function that is such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
           we pass two number then it perform the operation  Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
    Calculator inputs :> ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘type of operation’
Problem2:- find the nth odd number 

     Output: (examples)
        1) input a = 1, then output : 1
        2) input a = 2, then output : 1, 3
        3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5
        4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7

        5) input a = n, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, .......

problem3:-  problem 3rd is partially same like 2nd.
problem4:-  Get the total count of number list in the dictionary which is multiple of 
            [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
            (examples)
            input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
      Output:
            {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1} 
<!-- Problem4 :-
        solution:-
    step1    we use two loop to iterate the first array and 2nd array.
    step2    we will take 1 element from multiArr and then multiple with inputArr's elemnt 
    step3    if it is multiple then count++
    step4    otherwise show the count    
    step5    after showing one element's multiple count we assign the 0 value in count for next element-->
